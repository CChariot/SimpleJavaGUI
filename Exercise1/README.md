Use JavaFX graphics and the class hierarchy to draw a geometric configuration
comprised of a sequence of alternating concentric ovals and rectangles as
illustrated below, subject to the following additional requirements:

a. The code is applicable to canvases of variable height and width;
b. The dimensions of the shapes are proportional to the smallest dimension of the
canvas;
c. Only the drawing methods of the GraphicsContext object may be used for
drawing the shapes in the class hierarchy;
d. The rectangles and ovals are filled with different colors of your choice.
e. The colors used to fill the shapes in the class hierarchy are specified by an enum
data type MyColor. The enum type includes appropriate constructors and
methods, including methods that define, mix, and return colors.
