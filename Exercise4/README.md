a. Amend the database to include the following Tables: Students(studentID,
firstName, lastName, sex), Courses(courseID, courseTitle, department), and
Classes(classCode, courseID, studentID, year, semester, GPA) Table. The
underlined attributes are the primary keys of theirs corresponding tables. The
value of attribute sex may be either ‘F’ or ‘M’. The Only GPAs allowed in the
database are A, B, C, D, F, and W.
b. Amend Listing 25.2 to build and test a Java application that connects to the
amended database, creates and populates the Students, Courses, and Classes
Tables.
c. Amend Listing 25.2 to return and display the number of students enrolled in CSc
211 in the Fall 2019 semester and their GPAs.
d. Utilize the Java class PieChart in Exercise 3 to build and display a pie chart
showing the proportion of students for each GPA. In the pie chart:
i. Each segment has a different color;
ii. Each segment has a legend showing the corresponding GPA and number of
students;
iii. The segments for the GPAs are displayed in alphabetical order.
Your report should show all DML and SQL scripts used in a separate section with
appropriate heading. Your application should utilize JavaFX graphics and
“PreparedStatements” for the execution of SQL statements/queries. You may use any
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) of your choice.
